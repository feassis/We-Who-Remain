    probably tell you about expeditions.\r\nYou\u2019ll need to send crew members
    you unfreeze on\nexpeditions to gather resources. Unfortunately, the ship isn't
    \n100% self-sufficient, but we had no choice with the limited\n time we had.
    Desperate times, desperate measures and all that.\r\nAfter sending expeditions,
    your crew might contact you to\nask for guidance in making decisions. \nI know
    that might be hard and make you anxious, but I\u2019ll be\n here with you!\n\nTo...
    also be anxious and have decision paralysis...\n I believe in you!\r\n\nI\u2019ll
    be in touch after the first expedition returns. \nMeanwhile, I\u2019ll be working
    on the ship, and playing with Beepo\nbut mostly working on the ship!\r\n"
