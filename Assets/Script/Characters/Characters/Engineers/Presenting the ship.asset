  dialogText: "I think I\u2019m supposed to give you a rundown of the ship?\n I mean,
    of course!\r\n\nAll the systems seem to be working as expected, although\n some
    of the systems will need to be upgraded further to \nwork at full capacity. This
    poor machine\u2026 \n guess that's why they woke me up. I can help you develop\ntheb
    systems you are going to need.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, you might be able to see
    the facilities on \nyour console screen? Each OS update changes the UI \nso you
    might need to finagle a bit to find what you need. \nI\u2019m so sorry, I seriously
    hate that!\r\n\r\nEach facility uses energy, so that's what our nuclear \nreactor
    is  for! Don\u2019t worry, it can\u2019t be safer! I \ndeveloped it myself! \nWith
    my team\u2014of course\u2014who wouldn\u2019t stop complaining \nabout missed
    deadlines because I worry too much, and that\nmade me very anxious, and\u2014Point
    is: It\u2019s very safe!\r\n\r\nThe greenhouse is where we can produce FOOD.
    \nIf we plan to reach our destination in good health\n we should take good care
    of it!\r\n\r\nOur storage is where we store things? It's pretty \nself-explanatory
    I think? J\nust keep in mind that if we want to be safer about the \nresources,
    we should probably invest in expanding it!\r\n\r\nThe docks are how we can dispatch
    our crew to expeditions!\nI can make any SCRAP they might find out there useful!
    \nEven if only one dock is operational at the moment\u2026 \nand we have no crew\u2026
    \nSorry! I\u2019m getting ahead of myself again!\r\n\r\nFinally, cryogenics.
    This is how we\u2019ll get more crew members! \nYou can use this system to unfreeze
    the ship\u2019s personnel \nso they can help us in expeditions. \nJust keep in
    mind that each person has their own traits and \nunfreezing them takes time and
    energy. \nBut don\u2019t worry too much! \nYou have the entire remnant of humanity
    at your disposal.\n\n Oh gosh, it\u2019s dawning on me we\u2019re the last of
    humanity\u2026\r\n"
