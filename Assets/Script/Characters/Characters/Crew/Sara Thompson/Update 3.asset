    of my story with you. It all goes back to the day of the \ndisaster\u2014the
    day everything changed.\r\n\r\nI was flying an experimental jet for the military
    when it \nhappened. One moment, I was soaring through the skies, \nfeeling invincible.
    The next, there was this big, silvery flash, \nand my whole world turned upside
    down.\r\n\r\nAs I flew over the night side of the horizon, I saw them\u2014\ncolossal
    tendrils reaching up to the sky, like something \nout of a nightmare. It sent
    shivers down my spine, \nlet me tell you.\r\n\r\nIt was a day I'll never forget,
    a day that marked the beginning\nof the end for life as we knew it. But here
    we are, survivors, \nforging ahead into the unknown. It's a reminder that \nno
    matter how dark things may seem, there's always hope\n on the horizon.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for listening to my story, Commander. \nLet's keep pushing forward, together.\r\n"
