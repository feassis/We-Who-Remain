  dialogText: "Hey boss,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to shoot you a quick update on my progress.
    \nI've been diving deeper into my love for heavy machinery, \nand let me tell
    you, it's been a blast.\r\n\r\nBack on earth, I lived and breathed everything
    mechanical. \nFrom towering cranes to rumbling bulldozers, there wasn't \na machine
    I couldn't handle. There's just something about \nthe hum of an engine and the
    smell of grease that gets me going.\r\n\r\nNow, with the Remnant, let\u2019s
    say it\u2019s just a change in scenery! \nI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn't
    ecstatic to be around and working\nwith all this marvelous machinery!\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s
    keep at it!\r\n"
