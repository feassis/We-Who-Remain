  dialogText: "Hey Boss,\r\n\r\nJust wanted to drop you a line and share a bit about
    my \njourney so far. You see, back when the moon scorched \nthe planet, I was
    stuck on the night side, fighting tooth and \nnail to survive.\r\n\r\nI'll never
    forget the sound of machinery roaring in the \ndarkness, the only thing standing
    between me and oblivion. \nIt was a brutal time, but it taught me the value of
    resilience \nand determination.\r\n\r\nAnd now, here on the Remnant, not much
    has changed.\n I'm still using my machines to fight, albeit in a different kind
    \nof battle. Whether it's keeping our systems running or \nventuring out on expeditions,
    I'm giving it my all to ensure\n our survival.\r\n\r\nThanks for giving me the
    chance to be a part of something \nbigger than myself. Let's keep pushing forward,
    no matter \nwhat comes our way.\r\n\r\nCatch you later,\r\n"
