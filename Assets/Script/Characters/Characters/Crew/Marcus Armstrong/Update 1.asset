    I've been \nmaking strides in advancing my expertise. \nEvery day is a learning
    experience, and I'm determined to \nbecome even more skilled at keeping this
    ship running smoothly.\r\n\r\nBack in the day, I was knee-deep in engine grease,
    \ntinkering with all kinds of machinery. From fixing up old cars \nto building
    custom rigs, I've always had a knack for getting \nthings to work. And now, with
    the Remnant, it's no different.\r\n\r\n"
