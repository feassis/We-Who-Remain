  dialogText: "Hello Commander,\r\n\r\nI wanted to share with you the excitement
    I feel as I continue \nto embrace the unknown here on the Remnant. \nThe opportunity
    to explore the cosmos firsthand, to venture \ninto uncharted territory and discover
    new life forms\u2014\nit's a dream come true for me.\r\n\r\nBefore joining this
    mission, I spent years studying astrobiology \nfrom the confines of a laboratory.
    While the research was \nfascinating, there's nothing quite like the thrill of
    exploring \nthe cosmos in person, of witnessing the wonders of the \nuniverse
    up close.\r\n\r\nAs we journey deeper into the unknown, I can't help but feel
    \na sense of anticipation for what we might discover. \nWho knows what secrets
    the cosmos holds, what new life \nforms we might encounter along the way?\r\n\r\n"
