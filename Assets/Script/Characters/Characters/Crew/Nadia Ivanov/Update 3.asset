  dialogText: "Hello Commander,\r\n\r\nAs I reflect on my journey aboard the Remnant,
    I can't help \nbut think back to the day of the disaster\u2014the day the world
    \nwas forever changed by the silver eyes. It's a memory \netched into the fabric
    of my being, a reminder of the fragility \nof life and the resilience of the
    human spirit.\r\n\r\nI've heard stories from eyewitnesses who claim to have seen
    \nthe moon opening its eye, as if awakening from a long slumber. \nSome have
    even speculated that the moon itself is a \nmacro life form, a sentient being
    lurking in the depths of space.\r\n\r\nOf course, such notions are nothing more
    than fanciful \nspeculation, the product of overactive imaginations and \nthe
    fear of the unknown. As a scientist, I'm committed to \nseeking the truth, no
    matter how improbable it may seem.\r\n\r\nThank you for allowing me to share
    my thoughts with you. \nTogether, we will continue to unravel the mysteries of
    the \ncosmos and forge a path toward humanity's future.\r\n"
