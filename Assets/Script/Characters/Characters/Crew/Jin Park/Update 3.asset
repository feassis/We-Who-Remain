    disaster \nthat befell Earth\u2014the chaos, the devastation, and the \nsenseless
    conflict that consumed humanity even in its\ndarkest hour.\r\n\r\nDuring those
    final days on Earth, as the world teetered \non the brink of extinction, it became
    painfully clear that \nour greatest enemy was not some external force, but our
    \nown inability to set aside our differences and unite for the \ngreater good.\r\n\r\nNow,
    as we venture into the unknown depths of space, \nI can't help but feel a glimmer
    of hope for the future. \nAway from the conflicts and divisions that plagued
    our home \nplanet, we have the opportunity to start anew\u2014to build a \nbetter
    future for ourselves and for generations to come.\r\n\r\n"
