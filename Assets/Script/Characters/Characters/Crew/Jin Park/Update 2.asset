  dialogText: "Commander,\r\n\r\nAs I continue to serve in my role as Security Specialist
    aboard \nthe Remnant, I find myself reflecting on my past combat \nexperiences
    back on Earth. The chaos of battle, the \nadrenaline rush of confronting danger
    head-on\u2014it's a stark\n contrast to the relative calm of our space expeditions.\r\n\r\nDuring
    my time in the military, I faced countless challenges \nand witnessed the full
    spectrum of human conflict. It is \nhonestly refreshing to see the entire humanity
    working for \na common goal, leaving those meaningless conflicts behind. \nEven
    though there are only a few of us remaining,\nand fewer awake.\r\n"
